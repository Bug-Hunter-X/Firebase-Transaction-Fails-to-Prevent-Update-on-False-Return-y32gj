# Firebase Transaction Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug in Firebase Realtime Database transactions where the database is updated despite the transaction callback returning `false`.  This unexpected behavior can lead to data inconsistency and requires a workaround. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic scenario, and `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using a retry mechanism.
